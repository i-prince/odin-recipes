        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This vegetable soup is so good on a 
            chilly spring night and even better with a 
            grilled sandwich for lunch the next day. 
            By the way, you can omit any 
            veggies you chose, but don't use canned 
            vegetables. I promise you it's just better this way.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
