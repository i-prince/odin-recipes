        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup shortening</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>¼ cup dark molasses</li>
            <li>⅓ cup cinnamon sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Sift flour, ginger, baking soda, 
                cinnamon, and salt into a 
                mixing bowl. Stir the mixture 
                until blended, then sift a 
                second time into another bowl.</li>
            <li>Place shortening in a mixing bowl and beat until creamy. 
                Gradually mix in white sugar. Beat in egg and dark 
                molasses until light and fluffy. Sift 1/3 of the flour 
                mixture into the shortening mixture; stir 
                to thoroughly blend. Sift in the remaining flour mixture 
                and mix together until a soft dough forms.</li>
            <li>Pinch off small amounts of dough and roll them into 
                1-inch-diameter balls between your hands. 
                Roll each ball in cinnamon sugar, then place 
                2-inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are rounded and 
                slightly cracked, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on a 
                wire rack. Store in an airtight container.</li>    
        </ol>
