        <h2 class="chick4">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="chick7">
            <li>1 (3 1/2) pound whole chicken at room temperature</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons kosher salt, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>â…“ cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water, or as needed (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into four pieces</li>
            <li>black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="chick5">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="chick8">
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Dry the outside of chicken with paper towels. 
                Tuck the wing tips underneath the chicken and 
                place into a large oven-safe skillet. 
                Use scissors to snip off the tail, if desired.</li>
            <li>Generously sprinkle kosher salt into the cavity 
                and over the back and sides of chicken. 
                Tie chicken legs together with kitchen twine. 
                Sprinkle salt generously over the breasts, 
                coating them thoroughly. Wipe excess salt out 
                of skillet with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until an 
                instant-read meat thermometer inserted into a thigh, 
                not touching bone, reads 160 degrees C (70 degrees C), 
                50 to 60 minutes. Remove from skillet to a serving 
                platter and let rest 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Blot about 90 percent of the chicken fat from the 
                skillet with a paper towel held with tongs, leaving the 
                browned bits of food in the skillet. Place skillet over 
                medium-high heat and add thyme leaves. Cook and stir until 
                thyme is wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour lemon juice, chicken 
                broth, and water into skillet, stirring until
                the browned bits dissolve and the sauce has 
                reduced by about half, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low, add cold butter, and stir until 
                butter has begun to melt. Add any accumulated juices 
                from the chicken to sauce and continue to stir until butter
                 is incorporated and sauce is slightly thickened, about 1 minute. 
                 Remove from heat and season with salt, 
                black pepper, and cayenne pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over 
                chicken to serve.</li>
